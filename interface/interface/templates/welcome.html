      The purpose of this study is to determine how listeners distinguish musical groupings.
      You will listen to a number of musical excerpts and indicate the beginnings of perceived groups.
      By participating, you are contributing to an effort to better understand how
      our perceptual and cognitive mechanisms work, which can be used in the development of new musical technologies.
      The experiment includes 500 audio clips and each clip should take at least 30 seconds to complete. 
      You do not need to complete the experiment in one sitting.
      As long as the volume is kept to a reasonable level, there should be few risks in the experiment.

      Participants will be identified only by a randomly-generated ID in the data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you.
